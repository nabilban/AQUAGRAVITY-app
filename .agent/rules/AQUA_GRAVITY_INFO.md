Project Concept: "AQUAGRAVITY"
Tagline: Stay Hydrated. Stay Grounded.

1. The "Anti-Gravity" Core Vision
   The app redefines hydration tracking through the lens of physics. Instead of static charts, the user’s hydration level dictates the gravitational state of the UI:

The Weightless State: When dehydrated, UI elements (buttons, cards, data) float, drift, and use BackdropBlur (Glassmorphism) to appear airy and ethereal.

The Grounded State: As the user logs water, the UI gains "mass." Elements settle into place with smooth Curves.easeOutBack animations, representing stability and health.

2. Functional Requirements
   Smart Reminders: Contextual notifications that warn when "gravity is weakening" (dehydration).

Adaptive Display: A seamless interface that transitions from a bottom-weighted mobile layout to a multi-pane desktop dashboard using LayoutBuilder.

Intuitive Logging: A "Bubble-Lift" interaction where users pull a floating water droplet down to ground it, logging their intake.
